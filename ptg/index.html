<h2>Reflections</h2>

<ul>
<li>The journal is always looking for editors</li>
<li>The PTG education hub is immense</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classes I took</h2>

<p><h3>Debbie Cyr, RPT, on lyres</h3>
tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>use rags around a finished piece, if you want to clamp it into a workbench</li>
<li>use waxpaper when glue-clamping to keep glue off the wood</li>
<li>new glue doesn&#39;t stick well to old glue</li>
<li><p>Asian pianos sometimes have double-tenons, which the recommend dripping in epoxy, rather than disassembling/reassembling them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>lyre work involves a lot of tenons</p>
</li>
<li>this is an excellent class for experienced techs. I took away some things from it, but mostly it was an introduction for me<ul>
<li>maybe we should have her visit PVD for a technical?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jason-cassel-tune-refine-confirm-">Jason Cassel, &quot;Tune - Refine - Confirm&quot;</h3>
<p>perspective: learning to tune auraly is like learning manual transmission after learning on an automatic</p>
<p>his main idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tune: the octave so it sounds acceptable</li>
<li>Refine: with slow-beating intervals</li>
<li>Confirm: with fast-beating intervals</li>
</ul>
<p>Use an ETD, get paid, and each time, do a couple notes aurally. test against the ETD. get experience.</p>
<p>Tip: if you haven&#39;t yet tuned the test-note, you can move it around to hear the beats better.</p>
<p>He walked us through the different sections of the piano, and we got practice
listening and guessing whether intervals were wide or narrow. he used this to
illustrate his idea, but it was also just a great chance to practice hearing.
there should be more of this.</p>
<h3 id="nathan-mills-where-to-listen-">Nathan Mills, &quot;Where to Listen&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>My second time taking this; it was different from last time, he put in more.
He worked through an aural tuning temperament, the sliding 4th temperament,
because it lets you listen to a bunch of the same coincident partials.<ul>
<li>while tuning the midrange, all the coincident partials are in C5 to F#6 - get comfy listening there</li>
<li>while tuning the bass, your ear hangs out in the temperament</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>again: it was good listening practice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gold-hammer-forum">Gold Hammer Forum</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your clients, or at least remember: &quot;I did the best I can, and it&#39;s not my fault&quot;</li>
<li>don&#39;t constantly change your tuning hammer. it&#39;ll change all these variables...</li>
<li>push yourself to teach, to present, before you&#39;re ready. teaching teaches you.</li>
<li>dig into things that confuse you.</li>
<li>study things you don&#39;t intend to focus on. &quot;the more you know, the more you see.&quot;</li>
<li>always be honest about what you don&#39;t know. saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; is powerful credibility.</li>
<li>get-rich-slow: live below your means.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="louis-del-bene-rpt-wood-identification-for-piano-techs">Louis Del Bene, RPT, Wood Identification for Piano Techs</h3>
<ul>
<li>this was a great class, though it was very visual. it would make a great article or video hosted on the PTG website. i&#39;d recommend taking it if you can. maybe we could have him down for a technical?</li>
<li><a href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/62200">&quot;Wood handbook: Wood as an engineering material&quot;</a>, free PDF</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fran-ois-jerome-vincent-action-design-basics">Fran√ßois-Jerome Vincent, Action Design: Basics</h3>
<ul>
<li>this was way over my head</li>
<li>a magic line is a couple of arc radii that need to line up. two swinging pieces that need to touch just right, and if they&#39;re too close, it &quot;bunches&quot;</li>
<li>someone made an action that respected all the magic lines, and had almost no friction: and it was really hard to play! amazing repetition, but pianists need a little friction. the jack against the knuckle is the only point where they can control the hammer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dan-levitan-what-aural-tuners-think-about">Dan Levitan, What Aural Tuners Think About</h3>
<ul>
<li>probably my favorite session</li>
<li>he made an interesting distinction, one we&#39;re all aware of, but may gloss over: pitch vs frequency. A isn&#39;t always 440, it&#39;s a &quot;notional range of frequencies&quot;<ul>
<li>an interval can only be wide/narrow if you&#39;re talking about frequencies. Bb to F is always a fifth</li>
<li>pitch -&gt; music</li>
<li>frequencies -&gt; our craft</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>frequencies get faster as pitch goes up, but also lower energy: low notes have more energy. that&#39;s why they have more audible beats</li>
<li>an interval has a &quot;cloud of beats&quot;: the beats at each coincident partial. You&#39;re tuning them all<ul>
<li>false beats only really beat at ONE frequency - it&#39;s not the whole cloud of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there will always be beats in a unison; it&#39;s there for <em>interest</em>, for vibrancy. Unisons aren&#39;t there for volume; each new string adds minimal volume. &quot;your ear is not interested in unchanging.&quot;</li>
<li>we have interval tests to tell us an octave is too narrow, but none to tell us it&#39;s too wide - so we don&#39;t fix those. we don&#39;t have interval tests to tell if a 4th is too wide, but we have interval tests for a contracted 5th.</li>
<li>in equal temperament, we don&#39;t equally distribute all the semitones; we make the 8s, 5s, 4s, M3s and M6s all sound good, then we assume the m2s are good.</li>
<li>I like listening to Dan Levitan because, even though I have very little tuning experience, he helps me picture what&#39;s happening, and besides practice and reading, that&#39;s a very helpful way for me to continue my education</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="david-stanwood-dolge-s-dilemma-on-hammer-felts">David Stanwood, &quot;Dolge&#39;s Dilemma&quot;, on hammer felts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chopin is a kind of high-water mark for tone: soft and responsive. Chopin played on layered hammers: different leathers and felts. A density gradient: inner hard (for the fortissimo tone), outer soft (for the pianissimo tone). But, the hammers don&#39;t last because the outer-most layer, the soft one, breaks down</li>
<li>the Dolge press for putting the felt on the hammer stretches the felt at the edge, which makes it hard.</li>
<li>heat reduces felt&#39;s resiliency, and lots of hammers are heat-pressed to make them harder. this is why you have to needle them when they&#39;re new.</li>
<li>hammers of one density only sound good at one volume. He made a rubber hammer head that sounded great at medium volume, but it had no power</li>
<li>He has a technique for &quot;sugaring&quot; a hammer: stab it with a big needle, make a bunch of big holes, then use a ball-peen hammer to &quot;revivify&quot; the felt. He did this 20 years ago on a piano as an experiment, and it sweetened the tone, and it still sounds sweet: &quot;durable sugar.&quot;</li>
<li>he might also be a good candidate for one of our technicals; I think he&#39;s local?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jude-reveley-toby-hamilton-workspaces-that-work-">Jude Reveley, Toby Hamilton, &quot;Workspaces that Work&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>there&#39;s no right or wrong; only whether your workspace helps you, or hinders you</li>
<li>If you have a big space, you can have a permanent set-up, room to maneuver, room for parallel work.</li>
<li>Small space means it&#39;s less disruptive to move if/when you have to</li>
<li>Big vs small, but also, fixed vs mobile: fixed workstations for each task, benches; vs mobile carts that can be stocked with tools for a job.</li>
<li>Jude has everything on the wall on a French cleat, and then cleats on the mobile carts. He stocks a cart, and wheels it to where he&#39;s working. He has pegboards on cleats</li>
<li>keep machine accessories with the machine.</li>
<li>use your labelmaker</li>
<li>dowel pegs for rolls of tape</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-leadership-forum">Chapter Leadership Forum</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have members read through the chapter by-laws, especially new members. Anything to revise?<ul>
<li>we can call Kathy at home office to make sure they still comply. just send her a PDF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idea: have meetings on different weeknights; Thurs PM, Sat AM, etc. That way you don&#39;t sideline anyone based on their regular schedule</li>
<li>survey members who don&#39;t come: why not?</li>
<li>ask ONE member to organize a specific thing. more delegation and visible agency, less decision-by-committee. they can ask others for input, but it&#39;s up to them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="women-piano-technicians-forum">Women Piano Technicians Forum</h3>
<p>I was invited to attend this. It was a safe space for women to talk about
issues they face as women. I encourage anyone who wants to attend, to attend;
if you&#39;re unsure about it, talk to Ricki Klos.</p>
